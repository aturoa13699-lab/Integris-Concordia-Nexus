## Security Architecture

### What We Formally Verify

‚úÖ **Proven in Coq** (mathematically certain):

- Idempotence (replay attack immunity)
- Canonicalization (Unicode/normalization attacks)
- Rollback soundness (audit trail integrity)
- Single-writer invariant (state consistency)

### What We Don‚Äôt Verify (Trust Required)

‚ùå **Trusted Computing Base**:

- Coq proof assistant itself (decades of academic vetting)
- OCaml extraction process (formally verified by Coq team)
- SHA-256 collision resistance (cryptographic assumption)
- Operating system and hardware (standard hardening)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Verify Proofs Locally**
   
   ```bash
   cd coq/theories
   coqc -R . Integris V2_Decision_Application.v
   # Must complete without "Admitted" lemmas
   ```
1. **Never Bypass Verification**
   
   ```ocaml
   (* BAD: Directly manipulating state *)
   state.applied_cids <- CIDSet.add new_cid state.applied_cids
   
   (* GOOD: Use verified function *)
   let state' = apply_decision state decision in
   ```
1. **Run Security Tests**
   
   ```bash
   dune test --profile=security
   # Includes: fuzzing, timing attacks, boundary conditions
   ```

### For Operators

1. **Key Management**
- Store threshold key shares on separate HSMs
- Require two-person rule for all key operations
- Rotate keys quarterly (or after suspected compromise)
1. **Monitoring**
- Alert on failed idempotence checks (potential replay)
- Alert on multi-anchor quorum failures
- Alert on unusual state size growth (potential DoS)
1. **Incident Response**
- Keep emergency runbooks accessible (docs/emergency-runbooks/)
- Practice key rotation annually
- Maintain off-site backups of audit trails

### For End Users

1. **Verify Evidence**
   
   ```bash
   # Check that CID matches policy content
   concordia-ingest your-policy.json
   # Compare output CID to what was applied
   ```
1. **Audit Regularly**
   
   ```bash
   # Reconstruct historical state
   integris-rollback --to-date 2025-06-15
   # Verify matches expected state
   ```
1. **Report Anomalies**
- Unexpected policy applications
- Rollback failures
- Missing audit trail entries

-----

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Coq Extraction Trust

**Issue**: We trust Coq‚Äôs extraction to OCaml is sound.

**Assurance**:

- Extraction process itself is formally verified
- Used by critical systems (CompCert C compiler, etc.)
- Decades of academic scrutiny

**Residual Risk**: Low (but non-zero)

### 2. SHA-256 Collision Resistance

**Issue**: CID uniqueness depends on SHA-256 being collision-resistant.

**Assurance**:

- No known practical collisions (as of 2025)
- Would require ~2^128 operations to find collision
- NIST-approved algorithm

**Residual Risk**: Quantum computing could reduce to ~2^64 (still infeasible near-term)

**Mitigation**: Migration plan to SHA-3 or post-quantum hashes if SHA-256 broken

### 3. Timestamp Accuracy

**Issue**: Decision timestamps can be manipulated by operators.

**Assurance**:

- Multi-anchor verification provides independent timestamps
- Clock skew detection (warn if >5 minutes off)
- Audit trail includes anchor timestamps (immutable)

**Residual Risk**: Operator with root access could manipulate system clock

**Mitigation**: Use NTP with authenticated time sources, log all clock adjustments
